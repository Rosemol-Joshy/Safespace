Project Description
SafeSpace is a mobile-first, single-page mental wellness application designed to provide women with a calm, safe, and empowering digital space to understand and care for their emotional well-being. The app focuses on emotional awareness, self-reflection, and gentle support rather than clinical diagnosis, making mental wellness feel approachable and human.

SafeSpace allows users to check in with their mood through expressive emoji interactions, practice guided breathing and mindfulness exercises, view emotional patterns over time, and receive soft, personalized insights. It also offers an anonymous community and peer chat feature, enabling users to share thoughts and connect with others without revealing their identity. For moments that require deeper support, the app includes a coordinator chat and therapy booking interface with clear privacy and safety guidance.

Built as a frontend-only prototype, SafeSpace runs entirely in a single HTML file using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—without frameworks, backends, or installations. The design emphasizes pastel colors, glassmorphism, soft animations, and accessibility, creating a soothing and non-judgmental user experience.

SafeSpace aims to normalize emotional check-ins, reduce feelings of isolation, and encourage healthy coping habits, serving as a gentle companion for women navigating everyday emotional challenges.


The Problem statement
Many women struggle with stress, anxiety, and mood changes but lack access to mental wellness tools that are simple, private, and emotionally safe. Existing solutions are often complex, clinical, or require personal data, which discourages regular use and honest expression. There is a need for an easy-to-use, anonymous, and supportive digital space that helps women track emotions, practice calming techniques, and feel less alone.

The Solution
SafeSpace provides a simple, mobile-friendly mental wellness app that allows women to track their moods, practice guided breathing, and access gentle emotional insights in a private and non-judgmental environment. Through anonymous community support and optional coordinator interaction, the app helps users feel heard, supported, and emotionally balanced without requiring personal data or complex setup.
